                Once per solar cycle, when the canopy light filters gold through the high groves of Arboris, the great
                trees begin to stir,and so begins the Tree Whisper Summit. It's not a loud event. There are no stages.
                No parades. Just gathering,slow, quiet, sacred,among the ancient sentient trees that have stood
                since before memory. Here, people don’t come to perform. They come to listen..
                <br><br>
                The summit is led by a group of Elders of Breath, individuals who’ve lived most of their lives in
                communion with the tree consciousness. They arrive wrapped in pollen-threaded robes, walking barefoot on
                moss paths that lead deep into the spiral roots of the largest trees. Around them gather seekers,
                travelers, listeners,not for wisdom exactly, but for resonance. The trees hum during this time,low,
                rhythmic pulses felt more in the bones than the ears. It’s not language. It’s something more ancient..
                <br><br>
                As part of the tradition, participants are invited to press their palms to the trunk of a listening tree
                and silently offer a feeling,not a question, not a request. Just a truth. In return, the tree may
                pulse once, or ripple bark-light in soft waves. The Elders then take these emotional offerings and weave
                them into a choir of breath and tone, slowly building a choral atmosphere that fills the glade like warm
                fog..
                <br><br>
                The music is not always beautiful in the traditional sense. Sometimes it's raw, trembling,
                half-finished. Other times, it's so peaceful it moves people to tears without ever forming a word.
                Pollen-lanterns float between the boughs, and longleaf flutes sing in the hands of forest children
                nearby. At the end of the summit, the Elders plant a single memory seed, infused with the choir’s
                emotion,a future tree that will carry the resonance forward.
                Tree Whisper Summit isn’t about understanding everything. It’s about being heard by something that
                doesn’t need you to explain. It’s Arboris saying: You are felt. You are safe. You are part of something
                older than pain,and softer than fear.

                • Fast or eat very light beforehand — the forest “hears you better” when your body is quiet<br>
                • Be respectful of silence — words are used sparingly during this event<br>
                • Best location: Coda Grove, known for hosting the oldest communicative trees on Arboris
