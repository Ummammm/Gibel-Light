                In the high canopy sanctuaries of Auriel’s Rest, there’s a moment each year when the air turns warm and
                thick with soft light, and the trees begin to release their glowseeds. It begins without warning, or
                maybe it’s just that the forest doesn’t announce such things. The wind shifts, the pollen breathes, and
                then… it’s Seedfall, a planet-wide ceremony of release, rebirth, and gentle restoration.
                <br><br>
                During Sapling Seedfall, the golden canopy above loosens its grip on thousands of living seeds, tiny,
                featherlight pods that glow faintly and drift on the updrafts like whispers too soft to speak. People
                gather in open clearings, on woven root platforms and leaf-carved balconies, arms open, hearts ready.
                It’s not a spectacle. It’s a blessing. Each seed is encoded with harmonic frequencies meant to attune
                with emotional imbalance, guiding guests through a deeply personal kind of healing.
                <br><br>
                The central ritual is known as the Breathe & Let Ceremony, a collective meditation where participants
                sit in wide circles, surrounded by humming trees and soft music played on windroots and pollen flutes.
                During the ceremony, visitors are encouraged to reflect on something they’re ready to release: grief,
                fear, pressure, or even joy that has outstayed its welcome. As the seeds descend, some land on
                shoulders. Some nest in palms. A few hover… and then drift on.
                <br><br>
                Locals create seedcatchers, simple mesh keepsakes woven from bark thread and wish-grass, to collect a
                single seed that “chooses” them. These are often worn for the rest of the season, or planted later in
                silent groves with a whispered intention. Nearby, food circles form with pollensweet teas, earthbaked
                rootcakes, and healing stews made from canopy herbs. You don’t rush. You don’t shout. You rest, while
                the forest does the work it knows by heart.
                Sapling Seedfall isn’t about moving on. It’s about unclenching, even slightly. Letting the air carry
                what you can’t hold anymore. And knowing, as a seed lands softly in your palm, that you are allowed to
                grow differently now.

                • Remain still and open-hearted, the seeds are drawn to calm intention<br>
                • Planting your seed isn’t required, but if you do, place it where you wish someone could heal<br>
                • Best canopy ring: Sundream Vale, where seedfall forms slow spirals through the layered light
