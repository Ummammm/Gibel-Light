            <p class="text-justify">Lunara is often referred to as the heart that still remembers, a planet where memory
                is not just
                Tharuun is a planet of hush and hum. a deep-forest world blanketed in living moss, bioluminescent
                ferns, and whisper-root trees that seem to glow with their own quiet wisdom. Beneath its towering canopy
                lies a world not meant to be rushed. Light here doesn't pierce through, it settles. And if you walk
                gently, the ground will light your path in response.
                The most famous feature of Tharuun is its night-glow moss trails, which respond to motion and intention.
                Pilgrims come from across the Gibelverse to walk these paths at dusk, often barefoot, allowing the soft
                terrain to register each step with a subtle pulse of green or blue. These trails lead to Moss & Ember
                circles and communal fire gatherings held in glades where rootfires burn without smoke, and stories are
                shared in low tones or simply through presence. Food is passed hand-to-hand, drums echo through the
                trees, and silence is as sacred as speech.
                What makes Tharuun truly singular is how it seems to remember its visitors. Travelers who return often
                find the moss reacts to them more quickly, or that familiar pathways reappear in new formations. Many
                believe the forest forms a soft memory of every step ever takenm, not to judge, but to hold. Some report
                dreams shared with the trees themselves, often filled with old voices and new clarity.
                If you're seeking adventure, Tharuun may not speak to you. But if you're tired, if you're hurting, or if
                you're simply ready to be quiet with a planet that listens, it will welcome you without question. And
                perhaps, when you leave, some part of you will glow just a little longer.
                Before leaving, some travelers press their palms into the moss near a rootfire and whisper something
                they aren’t ready to say out loud. Not as a ritual, not even as tradition, just instinct. And in
                return, the ground hums back with a pulse so subtle, it feels imagined. But it stays with you. Long
                after you’ve gone, your feet remember the glow, your chest remembers the quiet, and a part of you still
                hears the forest softly saying: “I know. You’re not alone.”

                • Many moss-drums are sacred. Only join a circle if invited.<br>

                paths.<br>
                • During Glowrest Week (cycle 9), the forests bloom with phosphorescent threads that can be woven into
                keepsakes.
