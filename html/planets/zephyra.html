            <p class="text-justify">Zephyra is a planet in motio, not chaotic, not stormy, just… constantly in gentle
                flight. Suspended across its upper atmosphere are hundreds of levitating wind platforms, each one
                tethered by skyroot threads and stabilized by ancient airstone cores. From afar, the planet appears to
                shimmer, its surface dotted with specks of color that shift and sway like drifting lanterns. This is
                wind country, and here, the air is not just weathe, it’s culture.
                The surface of Zephyra is sparsely populated, not out of neglect but by design. Life here has risen
                skyward. The people live on drift colonies, massive breezeboards and floating gardens powered by kinetic
                sail farms that harvest energy directly from the ever-moving atmosphere. Travel happens by airstep
                gliders, personal orbs of light-woven fabric that ride currents with almost playful precision. There are
                no roads her, just wind paths. Invisible. Alive.
                Each year, Zephyra hosts the Wind-Harvest Fair, a celebration of skycraft, movement, and memory. Vendors
                on tethered stalls drift between one another, selling cloudfruit dumplings, sky-sewn ribbons, and
                wind-hummed instruments that sing only when held in a breeze. There’s no central squar, the fair
                expands and contracts organically, each platform catching the current like petals on a shared breath. If
                you find yourself in a spiral dance under a thousand sunkites, just know: you’re doing it right.
                The people of Zephyra are known for their jo, not loud or showy, but weightless. There’s a sense of
                lightheartedness here that comes from trusting the wind, from knowing that stillness isn’t always the
                answer, and that drifting can be sacred. It's the kind of planet that reminds you how much heaviness
                you've been carryin, not by confronting you, but by showing you how it feels to float without it.
                To stay on Zephyra is to let g, not of everything, just of enough. Enough to feel the wind lift you.
                Enough to laugh mid-glide. Enough to remember that direction doesn’t always come from map, sometimes,
                it comes from the next current that says, “Hey. This way.”

                •	First-timers should stay within Softdraft Zones — high-altitude currents are for locals only.<br>
                •	Hover gear is available, but many prefer to ride a bonded glider (they hum back if they like you)..<br>
                •	Visit during The Great Sway (cycle 6), when all farms re-align in one flowing arc across the sky.
