            <p class="text-justify">Arboris is not a forest planet, it is a forest. A single, planetary ecosystem of
                colossal trees, moving rootways, and soft-speaking canopies that breathe together in slow, harmonious
                rhythms. From above, the entire surface appears as an unbroken sea of green and gold, with ancient trees
                rising thousands of meters into the sky. Their branches stretch outward like arms held open, and their
                leaves shimmer in patterns that suggest thought, memory, and will.
                The flora of Arboris is semi-sentient, not in a mechanical sense, but in a way that feels deeply organic
                , trees that learn, remember, and communicate through a system of electrical pulses and subtle
                wind-signals passed between their branches. Locals, known as Rootborn, train for years to interpret the
                forest’s “language,” but even visitors can feel the difference. Stand quietly near a Heartgrove tree at
                dawn, and you may feel something shift in your chest, not a sound, but a presence. Something that knows
                you’ve arrived.
                Many travelers come seeking the Tree Whisper Summit, a sacred seasonal gathering where elders and
                wanderers gather beneath the central groves to share dreams, stories, and emotional frequencies. No one
                speaks aloud unless invited by the trees. Instead, participants place their hands on the trunks, breathe
                in sync with the rootlight hum, and offer feelings the way others might offer incense or prayer. What
                follows is often indescribable: color-waves in the canopy, tones in the air, the sensation of being seen
                by something older than time.
                Arboris has no true cities. Instead, it offers canopy sanctuaries, softly woven hammocks, air-temple
                clearings, and gentle platforms suspended in treelight. No lights are needed at night. The leaves glow
                just enough. If you stay long enough, you might begin to dream in pulses and wake with a phrase in your
                mind that doesn’t belong to you, but somehow feels like truth.
                To visit Arboris is to learn how to listen with your entire being. To be witnessed by a world that
                speaks in quiet. And if you're open, really open, the forest may offer you a single sentence that
                changes everything… not because it told you something new, but because it reminded you of something you
                always knew.

                Arboris isn’t just alive, it’s aware. This vast, ancient planet is completely
