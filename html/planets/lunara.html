            <p class="text-justify">Lunara is often referred to as the heart that still remembers, a planet where memory is not just
                preserved, but felt. Nestled among the gentler orbits of the Gibelverse, it glows faintly even from
                orbit, thanks to its vast fields of bioluminescent flora and psionically sensitive terrain. Travelers
                often describe their first step onto Lunara as a sensation of being "welcomed by something ancient and
                kind."
                The planet’s surface is covered in what are known as bloomfields, soft expanses of flora that shift hue
                and light in response to emotional presence. Anger might bring violet flashes; longing may turn petals
                silver; joy creates radiant gold blooms that ripple outward. These fields act as a living mirror,
                allowing visitors to see what they feel often before they even understand it themselves. No two paths
                through Lunara are ever the same, because the planet gently shifts with its visitors.
                At the heart of many bloomfields lie floating memory wells naturally occurring psionic pools suspended
                a few meters above ground. These shimmering basins allow those who approach them to surface forgotten
                memories, dreams left unspoken, or emotions buried beneath the day-to-day. The effect is never
                overwhelming; instead, it’s described as a gentle pull, like a song you once knew being hummed back to
                you. Many describe the experience as cathartic, even sacred. It's no surprise that Lunara has become a
                destination for healing pilgrimages, artists in search of emotional clarity, and anyone seeking to
                understand themselves a little more gently.
                Because of its deeply personal nature, Lunara is not a place for spectacle, it’s a planet of stillness,
                reflection, and slow awe. Sunset walks here are often silent, except for the occasional wind-chime flora
                or the soft hum of the memory wells themselves. If you come, come with a soft heart. The planet will
                remember you, and if you're ready, it might help you remember yourself.
                Some travelers leave Lunara with nothing but silence. Not because they found no answers, but because
                the questions finally stopped shouting. It’s said that if you return often enough, the bloomfields will
                begin to recognize you, responding not just to your presence, but to your path. There’s comfort in
                knowing a planet remembers your footsteps, not to trap you in the past, but to show you how far you’ve
                walked since.

                • Memory wells are strongest at dusk; guided dips are available via local Pulseshands.<br>
                • Emotional resonance may cause color shifts in clothing or equipment — non-reactive fabric
                recommended.<br>
                • Best visited during Petalfall Season (cycle 3–5), when the bloomfields release melodic spores at
                sunrise.
