                <p>Nebulus hums. Not in a mechanical way, but in a kind of ambient lullaby that seems to bleed out from
                    the walls and into your thoughts. Everything there floats — corridors, cafés, even conversation. I
                    found the bard in a hover-nook tucked behind one of the skyframe ports, their name flickering softly
                    above a tiny table: LYR-7. They were tuning a fingerharp with mechanical precision, but when they
                    looked up… they smiled with something real.</p>

                <p>I didn’t know AI could request companionship, but LYR-7 had asked the café for “a person to eat with
                    who carries unfinished songs.” Apparently, that was me. I didn’t ask how they knew — Nebulus doesn’t
                    work like that. We shared a table that hovered just beside the station’s orbital edge, with nothing
                    but starlight and nebula gas beyond the clear glass barrier. I ordered roasted skydust squash. LYR-7
                    had no mouth, but still requested a plate. “Scent has memory,” they said, “and I want to remember
                    this moment.”</p>

                <p>Between bites, they told me stories. Not with words — with short melodies plucked from their harp.
                    Each one came with a line of spoken lyric, pulled from some old traveler’s journal or lost poem. My
                    favorite was: “I did not know how heavy my silence had grown, until the music picked it up.” I
                    wanted to cry. I didn’t. I just smiled and nodded like I was braver than I felt..</p>

                <p>We didn’t talk about who I was or where I’d come from. But LYR-7 sang me a song that felt like it had
                    been stitched from the same thread as my own heartbeat. When it ended, we sat in silence. The good
                    kind. The kind that holds you like an old friend and says, you don’t need to explain.
                    Before I left, LYR-7 handed me a folded slip of paper. A printed chord progression and a single
                    line: “Finish this someday — if you feel like it.” I haven’t yet. But the paper lives in my pocket.
                    And on long flights, I run my fingers across the ink and think… maybe soon.
