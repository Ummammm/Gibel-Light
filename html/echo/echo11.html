                <p>The air was thick with perfume and petals. Not heavy — just… sweet enough to make you close your eyes
                    for a second. Above me, the floating gardens of Hedra drifted in perfect orbit, their
                    bloom-trellises weaving slow circles through the sky. I’d never planned to join the ring-dance. I
                    was just there to watch — a soft observer with pollen on her shoulders. But Hedra has a way of
                    pulling you into grace without asking first.</p>

                <p>The dancers moved in a spiral along a levitating root-ring — barefoot, slow, and smiling. Each wore
                    threads dyed in petal hues, layered to ripple like leaves on wind. Their steps weren’t
                    choreographed. They were tuned — to the hum of nearby bloomchimes, to the tilt of the garden’s
                    drift, to the feeling of the moment. No two moved the same, and yet every motion felt like it
                    belonged to something larger.</p>

                <p>A stranger — eyes kind, hands dusted in flower pigment — reached out to me and simply said, “It helps
                    you remember who you are.” And that was enough. I stepped onto the ring. The platform was soft
                    beneath my feet, pulsing gently like the rhythm of a quiet heartbeat. I didn’t know the pattern. I
                    didn’t need to. The music was light and slow and full of room to get it wrong. But I didn’t. Not
                    really.</p>

                <p>We danced under the falling petals until the stars came out. I didn’t speak to anyone else, but I
                    smiled at every passing face. And every single one smiled back — like we knew each other already,
                    just from sharing the same rhythm. At one point, I looked up, and the petals falling through the
                    garden’s orbital path looked like constellations unraveling.
                    When the ring finally slowed and settled, I stepped off lighter. Not because anything had changed,
                    but because I had moved in time with joy. And it had remembered me.
