                <p>It started with music in the distance — soft, fluttering, almost curious. I thought it was someone
                    playing a bloomharp in the floating garden. But when I turned the corner past a drifting trellis of
                    featherstem, I saw it: a drone, hovering just above the orchid path, its casing shaped like a single
                    open blossom. And it was… singing.</p>

                <p>Not in any language I recognized — but in tone. In light. In movement. It let out a soft chord as I
                    approached, and the petals on its chassis shimmered to a subtle pink, like it was blushing. At
                    first, I thought it was part of the festival installation — some elegant piece of programming. But
                    then it rotated, slowly, to face me… and released another note. Higher. Brighter. Almost as if it
                    liked me.</p>

                <p>The locals call them serenaders — semi-sentient drones that roam Hedra’s floating orchid gardens
                    during bloomseason. Not programmed to entertain. Just to respond. To mirror. To reflect whatever
                    beauty they sense around them — and sometimes, that includes you. Mine hovered gently in front of me
                    as I walked. Played a melody that shifted with my breath. Danced slightly above the blossom arches
                    like it was inviting me to follow.</p>

                <p>I did. We walked for nearly an hour. Sometimes it led. Sometimes I did. No words passed between us —
                    just tone and petal, shimmer and smile. At one point, it dipped close, and a small orchid unfurled
                    from its base. It hovered long enough for me to take it, then rose in a spiral and disappeared into
                    the canopy, song trailing behind like ribbon in the wind.
                    I pressed the orchid between the pages of my journal that night. It's still there, dried and quiet.
                    But sometimes, when I open to that page, I swear I hear that first note again — soft, bright,
                    curious. Like it remembered me too.
