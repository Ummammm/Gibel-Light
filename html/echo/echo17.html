                <p>You don’t just visit the Wind-Harvest Fair on Zephyra — you become part of it. The moment I stepped
                    onto the floating platform, the air felt alive around me, tugging gently at my sleeves like it was
                    asking, “Wanna play?”
                    Breezeboards floated in slow clusters, anchored by drift-chimes and skyfruit stalls. Everywhere I
                    looked: color, motion, invention. I wandered past a petal-glider booth, a wind-carver’s
                    demonstration, and a snack cart selling softleaf puffs that dissolved into cool mist on your tongue.
                    But it was the kite workshop that stopped me — not the kites themselves, but the laughter. The real
                    kind.
                </p>

                <p>The artisan waved me in without a word. Their hands moved with the ease of someone who'd done this
                    their whole life — weaving sunthread through breeze-cloth, attaching tail-ribbons scented with
                    sky-lavender. “The wind knows your mood,” they said. “Let it choose the shape.” I didn’t know what
                    that meant… until I tied the last loop, tossed it into the air, and watched my kite curve upward
                    into a spiral I hadn’t planned.</p>

                <p>It didn’t just fly — it danced. Twisting, pausing, dipping, rising. A reflection, maybe, of something
                    in me that needed air. Around me, others released their own kites, each moving differently: some
                    direct, some chaotic, some so gentle they barely floated. It wasn’t about performance. It was about
                    release. Letting something go, and letting the sky catch it.</p>

                <p>When the fair started drifting toward its next wind current, I folded my kite carefully and tied a
                    sprig of windheather to its frame. I didn’t take it home. I gave it to a passing child who said hers
                    had fallen into a cloud. She smiled, I nodded, and the platform carried us in opposite directions.
                    And just like that — the wind had taught me something.
