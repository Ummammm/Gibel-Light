                <p>There’s a hush that falls over Aurora Spires during Pollentide. It’s not silence — the air is full of
                    music, laughter, footsteps — but it’s all softened, like the planet itself is speaking in a whisper.
                    That evening, I followed a winding rootpath through the upper groves, guided by floating
                    seed-lanterns and the scent of warm spicebark. I didn’t know where I was going. I just followed the
                    light.</p>

                <p>The clearing opened slowly — not sudden, not dramatic. Just a wide circle of open canopy, the trees
                    bending inward slightly as if to listen better. In the center, people sat cross-legged in a wide
                    spiral, palms resting upward on their knees, eyes closed. Pollen fell like golden snow, drifting in
                    slow patterns on the breeze, catching in hair, on clothes, on the backs of quiet hands. Someone
                    motioned to an open space. I didn’t hesitate. I sat.</p>

                <p>The healing circle isn’t guided by a leader. No chants. No declarations. Just presence. Breath.
                    Intention. The pollen carries harmonic frequencies — subtle psionic waves that help realign
                    emotional patterns, or so the scientists say. But what I felt wasn’t clinical. It was human. My
                    thoughts slowed. The ache I hadn’t been admitting — the one I’d been carrying low and quiet — began
                    to rise like mist in my chest. No pain. Just acknowledgment. And then… exhale.</p>

                <p>One person quietly whispered a memory. Another hummed. A child giggled in their sleep. No one shushed
                    them. It all belonged. We stayed like that as the sky shifted to rose and the pollen glowed in the
                    warm light like it was blessing everything it touched. When it was time to leave, we didn’t say
                    goodbye. We just looked at each other — soft smiles, glimmering eyes — and stood. Whole, or maybe
                    just more willing to become whole again.

                    As I walked back beneath the high root-lanterns, a single seed drifted down and caught in the sleeve
                    of my jacket. I didn’t shake it off. I let it stay. A small, glowing reminder that healing doesn’t
                    always look like change. Sometimes, it just looks like being seen and staying anyway.About
