                <p>It was supposed to be a quick stroll. Just a light step into the maze, trace the soft-stone paths,
                    maybe catch a few mist-sculptures before sunset. But Cloudfall Day has its own plans. And Sylphae?
                    Sylphae loves to rearrange joy.
                    The maze was built on shifting platforms — soft coralstone tiles floating gently on the surface of
                    the overflow canals. As I stepped in, the mist thickened, blurring the lines between water, path,
                    and sky. At first, it was enchanting </p>

                <p>bridges curved like ribbons, lanterns hung from bending reeds, and music drifted in from
                    who-knows-where. I followed the laughter of children ahead… until it turned into echoes. Until I
                    realized I hadn’t seen another person in half an hour.
                    Was I worried? Not exactly. Lost? Very. But the mist was warm. The breeze gentle. I started noticing
                    details I wouldn’t have otherwise — flowers growing from the canal walls, blooming in time with my
                    footsteps. A flute note that repeated every time I turned left. A soft voice humming a tune I swear
                    I’d never heard, but somehow knew. It didn’t feel like being trapped. It felt like being… invited
                    deeper.
                </p>

                <p>I eventually sat at the center of a spiral bridge, feet in the water, watching soft droplets rise and
                    fall in gravity-play patterns. That’s where a local boy found me — maybe ten, maybe timeless — and
                    offered me a glowfruit jelly from a pouch. I asked how he found his way through. He shrugged and
                    said, “I don’t try to leave. The maze lets you out when it’s done with you.” He was right.</p>

                <p>Twenty minutes later, the mist parted. The canal reconnected. And I walked out the other side like
                    nothing had happened — except something had. I’d been still. I’d wandered without worry. And
                    somewhere in those foggy steps, the maze hadn’t just lost me… it had helped me find a little more of
                    myself.</p>
