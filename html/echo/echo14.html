                <p>They rise just before twilight — soft, glowing orbs made from bark-thread and breathlight, tied
                    loosely to seedstrings and released into the air like promises. Pollen-lanterns. I’d seen them from
                    afar before, drifting above the canopies of Auriel’s Rest like golden stars that had forgotten how
                    to fall. But this time… I was close enough to chase them.</p>

                <p>The forest clearing was filled with laughter — quiet, scattered, never overpowering. Elders tied
                    lanterns with practiced hands while children darted between trees, arms stretched skyward. I didn’t
                    expect to join them. I was just there to observe. But when one of the smaller lanterns dipped low in
                    front of me, trailing its thread like an invitation, something in me — ancient and unexplainably
                    joyful — ran.</p>

                <p>We chased them through pollen haze and rootpaths, between swaying saplings and high-bough arches. The
                    air shimmered with gold, the kind of gold that settles on your skin like a blessing. I laughed. Out
                    loud. The kind of laugh that escapes before you have time to be self-conscious. A small child beside
                    me pointed at a lantern just above our heads and yelled, “That one’s yours!” And it felt true.</p>

                <p>Eventually, I caught one. Not by force — it landed softly in my palm like it had chosen me. Inside
                    was a single glowing seed, gently humming in rhythm with my pulse. A nearby gatherer offered me a
                    seedcatcher to keep it safe. I didn’t ask what kind of tree it would become. I think that’s part of
                    the magic: you only know once you’ve planted it.
                    Later that night, I tied my own lantern — with a wish written inside, folded into a slip of
                    dreamleaf. I let it go with no ceremony, just a breath and a hope. And as it rose into the warm dusk
                    alongside a hundred others, I knew: some parts of healing don’t require effort. Just light. And the
                    courage to run toward it.
